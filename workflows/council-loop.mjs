/**
 * council-loop.mjs — standalone adversarial council fix-loop (background Workflow).
 *
 * Reviews whatever is already in the working tree (a feature/PR branch) and drives it
 * to an UNCONDITIONAL FOR:
 *   Review (advocate ∥ critic [∥ questioner]) → Arbiter verdict → Fix in-PR → re-review … → Verify
 *
 * This is feature-loop.mjs Phase 5 lifted out so any branch — not just one built by
 * feature-loop — can be put through the same council gate.
 *
 * RULES:
 *   1. NO NEW ISSUES. Every follow-up, defect, or nit the council raises is handled as an
 *      IN-PR update — applied directly to the working tree on the current branch. The
 *      workflow NEVER creates a GitHub issue or new branch for follow-ups.
 *   2. GIT IS IN SCOPE. Each fix round stages its work and commits with a semantic
 *      conventional-commit message, then pushes to update the PR — so the branch carries a
 *      readable per-round history. On an unconditional FOR it optionally squash-merges into
 *      the parent (set `merge: true`); otherwise it leaves the converged, pushed branch for
 *      the caller (the driver or feature-loop) to merge. The gh-pr-merge approval hook still
 *      applies — allow/approve `gh pr merge --squash` for an unattended merge.
 *
 * Invoke (from the driver, or nested via workflow()) BY ABSOLUTE scriptPath — the name registry
 * does NOT resolve ~/.claude/workflows/*.mjs (only built-ins), so `{ name: "council-loop" }` errors.
 * An absolute path resolves the same from any cwd/OS (a RELATIVE one would resolve against the
 * project cwd and break):
 *   Workflow({ scriptPath: "/absolute/path/to/.claude/workflows/council-loop.mjs", args: <TARGET> })
 *
 * TARGET = {
 *   title,                                    // what's under review (1 line)
 *   target: { branch, parentRef, pr },        // parentRef e.g. "origin/main" (default). Pass branch when known;
 *                                             // a pr-only target gets its head branch resolved up front so the
 *                                             // branch pin and merge target lock are never empty
 *   scope,                                    // optional: explicit "review only X / ignore Y" note

`${TITLE}${PRREF} reached an UNCONDITIONAL FOR and verification passed. Squash-merge it now. Stop and report if any step fails — never force.
TARGET LOCK (critical): the ONLY thing you may merge is the PR whose head branch is EXACTLY ${T.branch || '(the target branch)'} and whose base is ${PARENT.replace(/^origin\//, '')}. NEVER run \`gh pr view\`, \`gh pr ready\`, or \`gh pr merge\` WITHOUT an explicit PR number or branch argument — a bare call resolves against the checkout's current branch, which may be a DIFFERENT PR (e.g. the epic PR). Before step 3, confirm with \`gh pr view <ref> --json headRefName,baseRefName\` that headRefName is ${T.branch || 'the target branch'}; if it is anything else, report blocked:true and STOP.
0. IDEMPOTENCY (resume-safe): first run \`gh pr view ${T.pr || T.branch || ''} --json state,mergedAt,headRefName\`. If state is MERGED AND headRefName is ${T.branch || 'the target branch'}, do NOT merge again — report merged:true with that state and stop.
0b. ENSURE A PR EXISTS: if step 0 reported "no pull requests found" (the branch was pushed by a build agent without opening a PR), create one now targeting the parent: \`gh pr create --base ${PARENT.replace(/^origin\//, '')} --head ${T.branch || ''} --title "<type>(<scope>): <description>" --body "<one-paragraph summary of the change>"\` — the title MUST follow the conventional-commit format (e.g. \`feat(scaffold): ...\`). Then continue with the new PR number.
1. Make sure the latest work is committed and pushed (the PR should be up to date).
2. SELF-HEAL DRAFT STATE (a draft PR is the real merge blocker, not the approval hook): run \`gh pr ready ${T.pr || T.branch || ''} 2>&1 || true\` BEFORE attempting the merge (\`2>&1\` folds stderr into stdout so it is captured, not discarded; the \`|| true\` only guards the exit code). Capture and report the combined output verbatim regardless of exit code (so unexpected output, e.g. a permissions error, is surfaced rather than swallowed). If the PR was already out of draft this is a harmless no-op.
3. Squash-merge into ${PARENT}: \`gh pr merge ${T.pr || T.branch || ''} --squash --delete-branch\`.
3b. SYNC THE LOCAL PARENT AFTER A SUCCESSFUL MERGE (critical for stacked runs): the squash-merge happened on GitHub only, so the LOCAL ${PARENT.replace(/^origin\//, '')} branch is now stale — any later worktree branched from it will carry pre-squash lineage and its PR will hit a phantom merge conflict against the squashed parent. Run \`git fetch origin\` then update the local branch: if it is not checked out anywhere, \`git branch -f ${PARENT.replace(/^origin\//, '')} origin/${PARENT.replace(/^origin\//, '')}\`; if it IS the current checkout, \`git reset --hard origin/${PARENT.replace(/^origin\//, '')}\` (the tree must be clean at this point — everything was committed and pushed before the merge). Report that the sync ran.
4. IF THE MERGE FAILS, diagnose the REAL reason — run \`gh pr view ${T.pr || T.branch || ''} --json isDraft,statusCheckRollup,mergeable\` and report exactly ONE of these as the stop reason, set blocked:true, and do NOT retry:
   - "draft state" when isDraft is true (you should have cleared this in step 2; if it persists, report it).
   - "failing required checks" when statusCheckRollup contains ANY check whose state is FAILURE or CANCELLED (statusCheckRollup is an ARRAY of check objects — treat any FAILURE/CANCELLED entry as failing; an empty array means no checks are configured, so do NOT attribute the failure to checks).
   - "merge conflict" when mergeable is CONFLICTING.
   NEVER report "approval hook" (or "needs approval") as the stop reason — the approval gate is not the blocker; identify and report the actual draft/checks/conflict cause from the gh pr view output above.
Report the merge result (merged, blocked, and output including the gh pr ready stdout/stderr and any gh pr view diagnostic).`,
